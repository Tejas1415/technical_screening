## Technical screening:

Hey I am Ksenia - a data scientist at Airspace. I am excited that you made it to the technical screening in our hiring process. This little exercise intentionally gives very little data - I would like to get a taste of your skill, rather than ask for a lot of time investment. 

The `order_records.log` file consists of logs for each order, each having weight and volume, as well is an indication if the package information is either in imperial units (pounds and inches cubed) or not (kilograms and centimeters cubed) and a service_line of the order. 

1) Read and clean the data. 
2) Please explore the data. This is an open-ended question and could be done as an EDA, vizualization, a simple ML model to predict any of the values in the data. 
3) Please return your work in any format that you think highlights your skills and results best.
